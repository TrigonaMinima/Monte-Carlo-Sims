Monte Carlo Sims
======

Learning the conceps of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and coding some simulations along the way. Following is the list of sims done till now.

1. **Pi estimation**: Really inefficient way to find an approximate value of pi, but good for a starting point. [estimate_pi.py, estimate_pi_numpy.py]
2. [**Nagel Schreckenberg Traffic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagel%E2%80%93Schreckenberg_model): A simulation of a very simple traffic situation where, even though the initial conditions are simple we observe some traffic jams. [nagel_schreckenberg_traffic.py]

### Dependencies

- Python 3.6
- numpy
- matplotlib
